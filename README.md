# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Stage-Diagnosis
APTOS 2019 released a dataset on fundus images containing the stages of Diabetic Retinopathy as No_DR, mild, moderate, severe, and Proliferative_DR. I have used the same dataset and balanced it as No_DR and DR. Then if detected as DR it'll classify the 4 stages. The binary classification was to balance the dataset. I was trained with VGG16 and MobileNetV2. The images had built-in Gaussian filters to it.
